*** 

* Input 
* Processing Unit 
* Control Unit 
* Memory 
* Output

***
## 2.
### **A computer has 64MB(megabytes) of memory.How many bits are needed to address any single byte in memory?**
#### This will be 2^26bits to address each byte
## 3.
### **List basic parts of a CPU,include cache or not?**
#### CPU basic components are Arithmetic logic Unit,Control Unit.Not including cache.

## 4.
### **What mean secondary storage.List some on your PC.**
#### Secondary storage is a storage device that does not lose the data when the device is powered down,it is different to primary storage that is non-volatile.

### **Explanation**
***
### **CPU**
``` 
CPU(Central Processing Unit) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. 
```
### **RAM**
```
 RAM(Random-Access Memory) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used.
```
### **ROM**
```
ROM(Read-Only Memory) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices.
```
### **BUS**
``` 
BUS (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.
```
### **Parallel Computing**
```
 Parallel Computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.
```
## 6.
### **Decribe Cloud Computing**
### Cloud computing is a higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort,so you don't need to buy a higher-level device to solve the problem about your lower-level device which not having enough property to solve. It aims to cut costs, and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.

### **The Sun have bought a computer mainboard and the instrument shows that support dual channel DDR3-1333 SDRAM,the max size is 16G.**
### 1)What means about 3 and 1333 in DDR3 SDRAM?
### The "3" is talking about what type about the DDR
### The "1333" is taling about the Data rate about the DDR
### 2)If the Sun buy a 8G DDR3-1600 SDRAM,can it enhance the property of computer?
###  It can't enhance the property of computer,because the mainboard don't support the DDR3-1600 SDRAM,so it will be working in 1333 Data rate.
### 3)If the Sun buy two 4G DDR3-1333 SDRAM,can it enhance the property of computer?
### It can enhance the property of computer,because it have 2 SDRAM to work.
### 4) How many bits do the 16G RAM need?
### It need 2^34bits.
