## 作业 （part 1）
### Write out variables x,y and z in binary code
### 1. int8_t x = 67; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z = y - x;
#### Solution : x = 01000011 , y = 10000111 , z = 11001010

### 2. int8_t x = 0xd3;
#### Solution: x = No solution(Overflow)

### 3. uint8_t x = 0xd3;
#### Solution: x = 11010011

### 4.int8_t x = 127; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z = y - x;
#### Solution: x = 01111111 , y = 10000111 , z = 01111010(Overflow)

### 5. float x = 1.125;
#### Solution: x = 1.001

### 6. float x = 23.0;
#### Solution: x = 10111.0

### 7. float x = 0.45;
#### Solution: x = 0.01110011.... (Precision Error)

### 名词解释
### Method of complements
#### Method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers.
### Byte
#### Byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number.
### Integer
#### Integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.
### Floating point
#### Floating-point is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.
